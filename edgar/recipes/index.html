    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg*</li>
        <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (170 grams) tapioca flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (packed, about 66 grams) grated cheese, your preference, we get good results with feta cheese (no need to grate), or fresh farmer's cheese (if using fresh farmer's cheese, you may want to add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt (or more to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>


    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven, prepare mini-muffin tin: Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread a small amount olive oil around the insides of each well of a mini-muffin tin.</li>
        <li>Pour into mini-muffin tin: Pour batter into prepared mini-muffin tin, not quite to the top; leave about 1/8 inch from the top.</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake at 400°F in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until all puffy and nicely browned. Remove from oven and let cool on a rack for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake homemade Brazilian Cheese Bread in Oven</li>
        <li>Eat while warm or save to reheat later.</li>
        <li>Note that Brazilian cheese bread is very chewy, a lot like Japanese mochi</li>
    </ol>
