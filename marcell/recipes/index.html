        <li>Add the canned tomatoes, paprika and jalapenos; stir, using the back of a spoon to break up the tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>Simmer for about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crack an egg into a small bowl, then gently slip the egg into the tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining eggs.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs until the whites are firm and the yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>If the tomato sauce gets dry, add a few tablespoons of water. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon,
            place onto a warm plate, and serve with the tomato sauce and pita bread.</li>
