    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>First, get your salmon into the oven. All you’re doing here is putting the fish on a pan,
            seasoning it, and popping it into the oven. Set a timer and forget about it for awhile.</li>
            <li>
                Next, get your pasta going: dump some linguine into a pot of boiling, salted water,
                 and again: set it and forget it (well, maybe give it a stir or two if you remember).
                 The “home chef” part comes in with your sauce. You’ll start by cooking some garlic in butter,
                 and then adding cream, white wine, lemon zest, salt and pepper. You’ll cook this mixture about 
                 5 minutes or until it thickens into a, well, sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                By now, your pasta should be done cooking. Drain it well, pour it into the skillet with the sauce, add some capers and spinach, 
                 and give everything a good stir until the spinach is wilted.
            </li>
            <li>
                By now, your salmon should be done cooking, too! Take that out of the oven, break it into big chunks and put it on top of your pasta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grab a fork – it’s time to eatttttttt!

            </li>

    </ol>
