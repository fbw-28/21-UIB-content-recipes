            <li>1 pound medium shrimps, shelled and deveined</li>

            <li>Cook the asparagus in salted boiling water until crisp-tender. Drain and cool under running water; cut into 1-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Season the shrimp with salt and pepper..</li>
            <li> In a skillet, heat the oil. Add the shrimp and cook over moderately high heat, turning, until just white throughout, 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, bring 4 cups of water and the stock to a boil. Cover and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the wine and simmer until almost evaporated.</li>
            <li>Add enough stock to just cover the rice and cook, stirring, until the stock has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>Continue stirring in stock, 1/2 cup at a time, until nearly absorbed between additions.</li>
            <li>The risotto is done when the rice is al dente and suspended in a creamy sauce, 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cheese and remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Fold in the asparagus and shrimp. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
